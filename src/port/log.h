/* log.h — core 0's UART output, without blocking core 0 (design.md §4.3; EL §2.3).
 *
 * UART1 runs at 115200, about 11.5 bytes a millisecond, and a heartbeat
 * is a few hundred bytes: printf from core 0 would stall the field loop
 * for longer than the PCM queue's slack and cause the very underruns the
 * heartbeat reports. So core 0 formats into a ring and core 1, which
 * polls anyway, moves bytes into the UART FIFO as it has room.
